# Speech_Recogntion

This project aimed to develop a Speech-to-Text Recognition (STR) system for the Armenian language, addressing the need for advanced language processing technologies in this context. Leveraging state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, the system enables users to transcribe Armenian audio files with high accuracy and efficiency.
